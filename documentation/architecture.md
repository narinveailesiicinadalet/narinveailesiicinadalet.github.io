## TR is canonical; EN nests under TR

The site is mono-domain, bilingual. Only `docs/` is served by GitHub Pages;
the Turkish site lives at the root and the English site lives at `/en/`.
This is achieved in post-render by `shared/bash/sync-en.sh` which rsyncs
`en/_site/` into `tr/_site/en/`. The merged `tr/_site/` is then the
deploy source.

Consequences:

- English pages' canonical URLs are under `/en/...` — keep this in mind
  for `site-url`, `repo-url`, and sitemap generation.
- A change to `resources/` affects both sites simultaneously (single source).
- If only `./build-en` is run, `tr/_site/en/` is **not** regenerated
  (that sync runs inside the TR render pipeline). To preview the merged
  result, use `./build` or render TR after EN.

## Build vs deploy

These are separate operations, intentionally. Rendering does not publish.

### Render (local preview of changes)

| Command  | Effect                                                                  |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `./build`    | `quarto render tr/` then `quarto render en/`. Writes to `tr/_site/`, `en/_site/`. Runs all hooks. |
| `./build-tr` | TR only. `tr/_site/`.                                                 |
| `./build-en` | EN only. `en/_site/`. Does **not** re-sync into TR site.              |
| `./preview-tr` | `quarto preview tr --no-browse` (port 7777). Hot reload loop.      |
| `./preview-en` | `quarto preview en --no-browse`.                                  |

All scripts accept an optional profile argument: `./build dev` (default)
or `./build prod`. Profiles come from `_quarto-dev.yml` / `_quarto-prod.yml`
overrides applied on top of `_quarto.yml`.

### Deploy (publish to GitHub Pages)

`shared/bash/deploy.sh` is the only script that writes to `docs/`. It
rsyncs `tr/_site/` → `docs/` (with `--delete`). This is deliberately
separated from `build` so that multi-step editing sessions don't produce
a noisy `docs/` diff on every save.

Typical workflow:

1. `./preview-tr` — iterate on changes with hot reload
2. Commit small changes as you go (do not touch `docs/`)
3. When done with the work, run `./shared/bash/deploy.sh` once, commit
   the updated `docs/`, push.

`./build` also writes to `_site/` directories but its success message
says "`Output directory: docs/`" which is misleading — it does not copy
to `docs/`.

## Pre- and post-render hooks

The hook chain lives in `tr/_quarto.yml:pre-render`, `tr/_quarto.yml:post-render`
and equivalents for `en/`. Each entry is a script path relative to the
project directory. Order matters: failures abort the render.

**Pre-render:**

1. `shared/bash/clean.sh` — remove temp `.qrender-time.tmp-*.tsv` and
   stale debug logs from the previous run.
2. `shared/python/precompute_reading_stats.py` — walk every `.qmd`, compute
   reading-time / word-count stats, write sidecar YAML used by
   `filter_stats_panel.lua`.
3. `shared/python/render_timer.py start` — record wall-clock start time
   in `.qrender_timer.tmp.json`.

**Post-render:**

1. `shared/bash/sync-en.sh` (TR build) or the equivalent — rsync
   `en/_site/` → `tr/_site/en/` so the merged TR site contains both
   languages. On the EN-only build path this hook is a no-op.
2. `shared/python/render_timer.py end` — compute elapsed, print
   `Total elapsed time`, invoke `emit_render_json.py` which aggregates
   per-file timing TSV into `.qrender-time-<lang>.json`.

Renamed / deleted scripts here will fail the build loudly (pre-render
scripts run with `set -e`). A silent-failing pre-render hook is a much
worse bug than a loud one.

## Profiles: dev vs prod

`tr/_quarto.yml` declares `profiles: [dev, prod]`. `_quarto-dev.yml` and
`_quarto-prod.yml` are override layers loaded when the matching profile
is active. Profile is selected via the `--profile` flag passed by the
build scripts.

The exact differences between dev and prod overrides change over time —
diff the two files to see current state. Typical usage:

- `dev` is the default for local iteration. Lighter config, fewer
  optimizations, no analytics, faster feedback.
- `prod` is the default for publishing. Enables whatever is gated
  behind the prod flag (analytics, minification, strict link checking,
  etc. — again, diff to confirm).

When introducing a new config knob that should differ between dev and
prod, put the default in `_quarto.yml` and the override in one of the
profile files. Do not duplicate across both profiles.

## Known pitfalls

1. **`docs/` is tracked in git** because GitHub Pages publishes from it.
   Every deploy produces hundreds of diff lines, but this is not a
   problem in practice: `docs/` is only modified by `deploy.sh`, and
   deploy is the last step in the workflow — immediately followed by
   `git add docs/ && git commit && git push`. During the edit-preview-
   commit cycle, `docs/` is never touched (`build` and `preview-*`
   write to `_site/` directories, not `docs/`).

   A previous workaround using `assume-unchanged` flags (`ignore-docs`
   / `no-ignore-docs` scripts) was removed because it caused a stale
   git stat cache bug: updated sidebar HTML in `docs/` was silently
   skipped during `git add`, leading to deploys with missing content.
   A GitHub Actions `gh-pages` deploy would eliminate `docs/` from the
   repo entirely if desired in the future.

2. **Silent broken links via `css:` list**. Quarto does **not** fail the
   build when a file listed under `format.html.css` is missing — it
   emits a broken `href=""` into the HTML with zero warning. The
   pre-`3175ec3` project had `resources/plyr/plyr.css` in that list for
   a file that existed but was a redundant duplicate. Renaming the
   source file did not trigger any build error. Watch for this when
   moving static assets.

3. **Build timing is stabilized** (not real). `shared/lua/render_end_timer.lua`
   intentionally smooths per-file render durations: if the new value is
   within ±500 ms of the previously-recorded value in
   `.qrender-time-<lang>.json`, the old value is kept. Footer shows
   stable numbers page-to-page, and the aggregated "Quarto render time"
   line on stdout inherits the same stabilization. This means running
   `./build` four times in a row prints the same `Quarto render time`
   down to the millisecond — **not** a cache bug, by design. For actual
   wall-clock, read the `Total elapsed time` line that `render_timer.py`
   produces.

4. **`_site/` directories are not stable between `./build` invocations
   with different subset scripts.** `./build-en` updates `en/_site/`
   but leaves `tr/_site/en/` stale. Running `./preview-tr` after
   `./build-en` will serve the old EN copy until you rerun the TR
   pipeline. Prefer `./build` for a coherent snapshot.
